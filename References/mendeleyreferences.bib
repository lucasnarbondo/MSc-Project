abstract = {With increasing deregulation of the European electricity market, the quality of supply is becoming an issue of growing importance. Grid-connected electricity storage systems (ESSs) can enhance the quality of supply by: (i) shortening black-out periods; (ii) shifting excess energy for use during periods of high demand; (iii) sustaining the grid for better power quality. These problems are being addressed by using technologies such as power electronics and ICT. But storage systems offer a cheap and efficient solution to such concerns. ESSs can also power high-value, ancillary services. This paper analyses the new potential markets for storage systems in the context of distributed energy resources with a high penetration of renewable energies in the electricity networks. While lead-acid batteries are the most used technology in all types of stationary applications, many different storage technologies are claimed to fulfil the technical requirements of the above applications, in particular the emerging ones. Therefore, a comparison is made of lead-acid technology and its competitors in terms of technical and economic considerations. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {In recent years, a lot of distributed generations such as photo-voltaic and wind power generations are going to be installed in power systems. However, these generator output changes affect the system frequency. In this paper, the authors propose a system-atic method to estimate an appropriate battery storage kWh capacity and its power converter kW capacity for suppressing the system fre-quency fluctuation caused by the wind power output change. Three types of wind power outputs shown in Fig. 1 are used here. The maximum change of the wind power generation output is about 1524 (MW) in each case. The initial stored capacity (MWh) at time t = 0 is assumed to be a half of the required capacity. The proposed systematic method is described as follows: First, the required power converter capacity (MW) of the battery and the initial value in minimization process of the battery storage capacity (MWh) are calculated for the step input of wind power as-sumed in Fig. 2. The value of the step input is the same one as the assumed maximum change of the wind power generation out-put mentioned before. The initial MWh value is used to evaluate the required minimum battery storage capacity (MWh) under the Fig. 1. Output changes from wind power plants Fig. 2. Output power change from battery and LFC system condition that the probability of the frequency existing within the reference value of the deviation is over 98 percents during the sim-ulation period, 600 sec. here. The frequency changes in Case1 to Case3 with the battery system obtained by the proposed method and without the battery system are shown in Figs. 3 and 4, respectively. In case without the battery system, Figure 4 shows that the fre-quency deviation exceeds 0.2 Hz. It has been made it clear that the proposed battery system works effectively and that the proposed es-timation method for minimizing the battery storage capacity can be available for the practical design. It has also been concluded that the battery control system should be coordinated with LFC system of thermal power plants and hydro power plants to obtain the mini-mum required capacity of the battery.

The question of whether or how much pumped storage to include is addressed by formulating a linear programming optimization problem. The stochastic nature of load and renewable production is addressed using scenarios developed through fuzzy clustering. Both the unit capacity in MW and the reservoir storage capacity in MWh are optimized, and optimal operating strategies for the scenarios are produced. Results showed that including pumped storage can be an effective means of allowing larger penetration of intermittent renewable energy sources, improving both the dynamic security and the economic operation of a test system. Including the dynamic security criteria in the economic question of dimensioning the pumped storage unit proved to make a significant difference in the optimal pumped storage capacity.},

abstract = {Currently, the electric power sector is looking forward towards increasing the bent for availability, reliability and security of energy supply to consumers. This pursuit has vehemently increased the intention for integrating renewable energy (RE) into the electricity sector as a strategy to curb the problem of energy deficiency especially in isolated off-grid settlements. However, the variability in the sources of RE supply coupled with conditional changes in the level of energy consumption with respect to time has brought to focus the necessity for energy storage systems (ESSs). Despite the stochastic nature of RE produced from solar and wind energy and to some extent hydro, interest in their exploitation is still growing high due to their sustainability regarding environmental receptiveness. Thus, this paper extensively reviews the state of the art of three different kinds of energy storage technologies (pumped hydroelectricity storage, batteries and fuel cells) suitable for the integration and management of intermittency in RE. Within the context of the review, advantages and disadvantages of the various technologies are also presented. Additionally, it also pin-points on the different areas of applications of ESSs for RE integration and offers review summary on factors to be considered for selecting appropriate energy storage technology for either commercial or domestic applications. Finally, the paper concluded that ESSs selection is based on performance characteristics and fuel source used whereas no single ESS can meet all the possible requirements to be called a supreme ESS. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

We examined how we could achieve very high-energy penetration from intermittent renewable system into the electricity grid. This study shows that the maximum threshold for the storage need is significantly less than the daily average demand. In the present study, we found that the approximate network energy storage is of the order of 186. GW. h/22. GW (approximately 22{\%} of the average daily demands of California). Allowing energy dumping was shown to increase storage use, and by that way, increases grid penetration and reduces the required backup conventional capacity requirements. Using the 186. GW. h/22. GW storage and at 20{\%} total energy loss, grid penetration was increased to approximately 85{\%} of the annual demand of the year while also reducing the conventional backup capacity requirement to 35. GW. This capacity was sufficient to supply the year round hourly demand, including 59 GW peak demand, plus a distribution loss of about 5.3{\%}.

abstract = {In this paper, we address the optimal energy storage management and sizing problem in the presence of renewable energy and dynamic pricing. We formulate the problem as a stochastic dynamic programming problem that aims to minimize the long-term average cost of conventional generation used as well as investment in storage, if any, while satisfying all the demand. Stor- age is modeled with ramp constraints, conversion losses, dissipation losses and investment cost. Assuming the renewable energy, demand and prices evolve as exogenous stochastic processes, we show the existence of the optimal storage management policy. The policy is a dual-threshold dependent balancing policy with thresholds that decrease with prices. Under this policy, we provide structural results that help in computing the optimal storage size efficiently. We char- acterize how the cost and efficiency of storage, dynamic pricing and the uncertainty in the system impact the size of optimal storage and its gain. In a surprising result we prove that under constant prices for storage to be profitable the ratio of the amortized cost of storage to the price of electricity should be less than 14 . We present a numerical study on real-world data that demonstrates the implementation of the optimal policy and provides realistic savings using storage.},

abstract = {Energy storage can alleviate the problems that the uncertainty and variability associated with renewable energy sources such as wind and solar create in power systems. Besides applications such as frequency control, temporal arbitrage or the provision of reserve, where the location of storage is not particularly relevant, distributed storage could also be used to alleviate congestion in the transmission network. In such cases, the siting and sizing of this distributed storage is of crucial importance to its cost-effectiveness. This paper describes a three-stage planning procedure to identify the optimal locations and parameters of distributed storage units. In the first stage, the optimal storage locations and parameters are determined for each day of the year individually. In the second stage, a number of storage units is available at the locations that were identified as being optimal in the first stage, and their optimal energy and power ratings are determined. Finally, in the third stage, with both the locations and ratings fixed, the optimal operation of the storage units is simulated to quantify the benefits that they would provide by reducing congestion. The quality of the final solution is assessed by comparing it with the solution obtained at the first stage without constraints on storage sites or size. The approach is numerically tested on the IEEE RTS 96.},

We demonstrate this framework using case studies based on the IEEE 14-bus test system with four different storage technologies. Our results show that although certain technologies are generally classified as being suitable for either power or energy services, many technologies can add value to the system by performing both fast-time scale regulation (power) and load-shifting (energy) services. These results suggest that limiting the type of service that a certain technology is compensated for may result in inefficiencies at the system level and under-valuation of storage.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE. Energy storage devices (ESDs) have the potential to revolutionize the electricity grid by allowing the smoothing of variable-energy generator output and the time-shifting of demand away from peak times. A common approach to study the impact of ESDs on energy systems is by modeling them as electric circuits in simulations. Although recent circuit models are becoming more accurate, to obtain statistically valid results, extensive simulations need to be run. In some cases, existing datasets are not large enough to obtain statistically significant results. The impact of ESDs on energy systems has also been recently studied using analytical methods, but usually by assuming ideal ESD behavior, such as infinite ESD charging and discharging rates, and zero self-discharge. However, real-life ESDs are far from ideal. We investigate the effect of nonideal ESD behavior on system performance, presenting an analytical ESD model that retains much of the simplicity of an ideal ESD, yet captures many (though not all) nonideal behaviors for a class of ESDs that includes all battery technologies and compressed air energy storage systems. This allows us to compute performance bounds for systems with nonideal ESDs using standard teletraffic techniques. We provide performance results for five widely used ESD technologies and show that our models can closely approximate numerically computed performance bounds.},

One option considered in many studies dealing with prospective power systems is the installation of storage devices to balance the fluctuations in power production. However, it is not yet clear how soon storage devices will be needed and how the integration process depends on different storage parameters. Using long-term solar and wind energy power production data series, we present a modelling approach to investigate the influence of storage size and efficiency on the pathway towards a 100{\%} RES scenario. Applying our approach to data for Germany, we found that up to 50{\%} of the overall electricity demand can be met by an optimum combination of wind and solar resources without both curtailment and storage devices if the remaining energy is provided by sufficiently flexible power plants. Our findings show further that the installation of small, but highly efficient storage devices is already highly beneficial for the RES integration, while seasonal storage devices are only needed when more than 80{\%} of the electricity demand can be met by wind and solar energy. Our results imply that a compromise between the installation of additional generation capacities and storage capacities is required.},

Models developed to represent different functional processes and systems are seen as useful tools to support the related studies for different stakeholders in a tangible way. This paper presents an overview of modeling approaches applied to support aggregation-based management and integration of PEVs from the perspective of fleet operators and grid operators, respectively. We start by explaining a structured modeling approach, i.e., a flexible combination of process models and system models, applied to different management and integration studies. A state-of-the-art overview of modeling approaches applied to represent several key processes, such as charging management, and key systems, such as the PEV fleet, is then presented, along with a detailed description of different approaches. Finally, we discuss several considerations that need to be well understood during the modeling process in order to assist modelers and model users in the appropriate decisions of using existing, or developing their own, solutions for further applications.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 by the authors. Many countries have the ambition to increase the share of renewable sources in electricity generation. However, continuously varying renewable sources, such as wind power or solar energy, require that the power system can manage the variability and uncertainty of the power generation. One solution to increase flexibility of the system is to use various forms of energy storage, which can provide flexibility to the system at different time ranges and smooth the effect of variability of the renewable generation. In this paper, we investigate three questions connected to investment planning of energy storage systems. First, how the existing flexibility in the system will affect the need for energy storage investments. Second, how presence of energy storage will affect renewable generation expansion and affect electricity prices. Third, who should be responsible for energy storage investments planning. This paper proposes to assess these questions through two different mathematical models. The first model is designed for centralized investment planning and the second model deals with a decentralized investment approach where a single independent profit maximizing utility is responsible for energy storage investments. The models have been applied in various case studies with different generation mixes and flexibility levels. The results show that energy storage system is beneficial for power system operation. However, additional regulation should be considered to achieve optimal investment and allocation of energy storage.},
